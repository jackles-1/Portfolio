		<p>Hello! My name is Jackie, and I&rsquo;m a web developer living in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado. I discovered programming in a part-time job I had after graduating with a degree in chemistry. I love science and loved studying chemistry, but after concluding my path no longer involved being a chemist, I took a part-time job at my local county. After being brought in to help migrate data to a new database application, I quickly discovered I had a knack for SQL. One thing led to another, and when that position ended, I was brought back as part of the tech team, where I got to continue working with SQL and became the department Python go to.</p> 

		<p>I loved these experiences. After leaving chemistry I had struggled to fill the void of &ldquo;left-brained&rdquo; thinking in my life. I love organizing and manipulating information, and programming fit that niche perfectly. My chemistry degree showed me that I am a lover of learning, and it has been thrilling to continue learning and teaching myself this new craft&mdash;one that not only flexes all the right mental muscles for me, but is also a gateway into all of the fields I am most passionate about. I would love to someday apply my skills to one of the causes that are deeply important to me: healthcare access, mental health advocacy, and environmental and wildlife conservation to start the list.</p>

		<p>I spend most of my free time outdoors in typical Boulder fashion&mdash;I am an avid rock climber, hiker, skier, and dog walker. I am also an animal fanatic and love interacting with animals, and learning about animal behavior and wildlife biology. These days, that interest is mostly fulfilled by trying to understand the quirks of my cat, Momo. Finally, I am a devoted traveler&mdash;I am hugely passionate about going to places outside of my comfort zone where the customs are different, but I am inevitably reminded that we are all the same.</p>
